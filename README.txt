In C#, strings are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after they are created. The Array.Reverse method works on arrays, not strings. To reverse a string using Array.Reverse, you need to:

Convert the string to a character array: This allows you to work with the individual characters of the string as if they were elements of an array.

string a = "AJAY";
char[] charArray = a.ToCharArray(); // Converts the string to a character array
Reverse the character array: Array.Reverse will reverse the order of the elements in the array.


Array.Reverse(charArray); // Reverses the order of characters in the array
Convert the reversed character array back to a string: After reversing, you can create a new string from the reversed array.


string reversed = new string(charArray); // Creates a new string from the reversed array
Why Convert String to Array?
Immutability: Strings in C# are immutable, so their contents cannot be modified directly. By converting the string to a character array, you can modify the order of characters.
Array Manipulation: Arrays, unlike strings, allow you to modify their contents directly, which is why Array.Reverse can be used.
